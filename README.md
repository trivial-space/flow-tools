# Trivial space flow tools

Tools for real time manipulation and inspection of trivial space flow graphs.

The core tool is a graph visualizer, that can be added to any website that uses a flow runtime.
It can visualize the data flow graph, inspect and edit current entity node values. This makes experimenting with program parameters very easy. The visual tool is build using [Inferno.js](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno).

Other utilities, like a console tool and some webpack helpers are part of this project as well.

Developed and build for usage with TypeScript.

*This library is fluctuating a lot, and changed frequently. Not recommended for production usage!*

Flow tools are used primarily in the [trivial space playground](https://github.com/trivial-space/playground) to experiment with graphics live coding inside browsers. See it in action there.
